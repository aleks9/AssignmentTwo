    Use Cases / User Stories
</p>
<p>
    Since the user that we will be focusing on is the clerk, we will be creating user cases and stories for only the clerk. A typical clerk processes all the
    customer services, like renting a vehicle, returning a vehicle, etc.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Use Cases</strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. <strong>Log into the system:</strong> Clerk is asked to enter username and password to login into the system. This will display menu selections to
    process rental, process vehicle return and show reports.
</p>
<p>
    2. <strong>Processes renting a vehicle:</strong> Clerk will either enter a new rental or process a rental from an existing reservation. Information
    included will be type of vehicle and return date and time and insurance coverage.
</p>
<p>
    3. <strong>Returning a vehicle:</strong> The clerk enters the date, time time and odometer reading and whether the gas tank is full. The Clerk then
    displays total cost and takes payment for the bill.
</p>
<p>
    4. <strong>Clerk brings up reports</strong>;
</p>
<p>
    I. Show the vehicles of a specified catgory that are available in a given location for a given set dates (usually given as form-date and to date)
</p>
<p>
    II. Show the vehicles in a specified location and category that are overdue
</p>
<p>
    III. Show the vehicles in a specified location and category that are for sale and their sale prices
